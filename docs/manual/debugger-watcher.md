# Watcher

```{index} Watcher, watch
```

![The Watcher](images/dbg-watcher.png)

The **Watcher** window shows the registers and some places in memory, and follows them
while the machine runs. Open it with **Tools > Watcher** in the main window, or
**Watcher** under the {icon}`other` **Tools** button over the listing.

1. **CPU** - the registers.
2. **MEMORY** - the watches, two rows each.
3. The four memory banks, from `#0000` to `#C000`: ROM or RAM, and the page.

In the picture the game Exolon runs, with a file of labels for it. `AMMO` is its ammo
counter: the first byte, `63`, is 99 rounds. `VITORC + 0x60` is the second frame of its
hero's sprite. `SP` is the stack, and `[SP]` the code the routine will return to.
`0x3D00` is the start of the font in ROM.

Right-click the **MEMORY** list and choose **Add watcher** to add a watch, or
**Delete watcher** to remove the selected one. Double-click a watch to change it.


```{index} Watcher Editor
```

![The Watcher Editor](images/dbg-watcher-editor.png)

The **Watcher Editor** has:

- **Type** - **CPU addr** reads through the current CPU mapping; **RAM addr** and **ROM addr**
  read physical memory. A label in a physical watch supplies its page as well as its offset;
- **Expression** - an address, in the same syntax as a condition (see
  [Conditions](debugger-breakpoints.md#conditions)): `HL`, `0x5C3A`, `IX + 5`, `[0x5C53]`, a label. The
  {icon}`label` button beside it opens the list of labels; a label picked there goes into
  the field.

{icon}`checkbox` **OK** accepts the watch only when the expression is right. The first row
of a watch shows its type and expression, and its value as an address; the second row the
13 bytes that start at that address. `??` means the expression cannot be worked out at the moment.

On the Next, a label in a **CPU addr** watch follows MMU paging. If its page is not mapped,
the watch shows `??`; a **RAM addr** watch still reads the label's own RAM page.

The watches are not kept when the program closes.

## Watched ports

The **PORTS** block of the **MEMMAP** panel shows the last value on the ports you choose.
See [Watched ports](debugger-memmap.md#watched-ports).
