# MEMMAP panel

```{index} MEMMAP panel, memory bank
```

![The MEMMAP panel](images/dbg-memmap.png)

The **MEMMAP** panel holds a few small blocks, one under another. The **Debugger** page of
**Options** sets which of them are shown.

The rows at the top are the Z80's memory windows: four 16K banks on most machines, or the
eight 8K MMU slots on a ZX Spectrum Next. They show the kind and page number, and let you
put another page into a window. See
[Memory windows](#memory-windows).

```{index} FMAPS, TSConf; FMAPS
```

On the **ZX Evolution (TSConf)** a fifth row says where the FMAPS window is: `FM #0000`
when port `15AF` (**FMAddr**) has switched it on at `#0000`, `FM off` when it is off. The
window is for writing only: a write in its first `#0500` bytes also goes to the palette
(CRAM, from `+#000`), the sprite descriptors (SFILE, from `+#200`) or the TSConf registers
(from `+#400`, one byte for each port `#xxAF`), and a read gives what is in the bank. The
row and these bytes in the dump are drawn in the **FMAPS** color; the tooltip of a byte
in the dump says where a write to it goes.

**PORTS** lists the watched ports and the last value on each. For a port whose value the
machine keeps in a register, such as `7FFD` on a 128K, the value shown is that register's;
for any other port it is the last byte read from it or written to it, and `--` until the
port is used.

```{index} SIGNALS
```

**SIGNALS** are four words that are bold while the signal is on:

- **DOS** - the TR-DOS ROM is switched in;
- **ROM** - the ROM bit of port `7FFD` is set; on a 128K that is the 48K BASIC ROM;
- **CPM** - the machine is in its CP/M mode;
- **INT** - an interrupt is waiting and the CPU will take it.

```{index} FRAME, frame counter, Reset counter
```

**FRAME** counts the frames since the last reset. Right-click it and choose
**Reset counter** to start it again from 0, for example to count the frames until
something happens. Breakpoint conditions read the same number as `FRAME` (see
[Breakpoints panel](debugger-breakpoints.md)).

```{index} RAY, beam position
```

**RAY** is where the beam is on the frame: X on the first line, Y on the second. X is bold
during the line's blanking, Y during the frame's.

## Memory windows

```{index} MEMMAP panel; paging in, Restore mapping, paging
```

![The MEMMAP panel](images/dbg-memmap.png)

On most machines the four rows at the top of the **MEMMAP** panel are the four 16K windows
of the CPU's memory: 0000-3FFF, 4000-7FFF, 8000-BFFF and C000-FFFF. Hold the mouse over a
row to see its addresses. Each row says what is in that window now, **ROM** or **RAM**, and
the number of the page.

On a ZX Spectrum Next there are eight 8K rows instead, one for each MMU register: 0000-1FFF,
2000-3FFF and so on. The page is the exact value of NextReg 50-57. **RAM** is a page below
E0; a value from E0 to FF selects **ROM** in either of the first two slots and is **OFF**
in the other six. The tooltip also says what the CPU reads there after divMMC, Multiface,
Layer 2 and ROMCS have been applied: a RAM page, a ROM, a divMMC page, the Multiface's
memory, or nothing. The listing, the **CPU** dump, memory search and breakpoints follow that
same view.

On every machine the listing shows memory as it is now, with one exception: the row at PC
shows the instruction the CPU will run next. If fetching it pages something in - a divMMC
entry point, or the Next's Multiface at 0066 - that row already shows it, and a step runs
exactly that. A divMMC entry point such as 0008 pages the board in for the instruction after
it: stopped at 0008, the listing shows the ROM; after the step, at 000B, the listing, the
**DUMP** and **MEMMAP** already show the board, since the next fetch brings it in whatever
it is. Other rows show what is there now; they change when the CPU gets there.

Change a row to put another page in: pick **ROM** or **RAM** and type the page number. On a
Next, typing a value writes its 8K MMU register; picking **ROM** writes FF and **OFF** writes
FF to one of the six slots that can be unmapped. The **DUMP**, the listing and the CPU itself
then see that page there. A window you changed has
its type in bold and its page number highlighted. The page stays there until the program
itself pages that window.

Right-click the rows, or the **MEMMAP** title, and choose **Restore mapping** to put back
all four windows, or all eight Next MMU registers, as they were when the Debugger opened.

On other ZX machines, while a [divMMC](divmmc.md) has its memory in the first 16K
window, that row says **DIV** and the number of the board's 8K RAM page at `#2000`. The
board pages it by itself, so this row cannot be changed then.

On TSConf a fifth row, `FM`, shows where the FMAPS window is (see
[The FMAPS window on TSConf](debugger-memory.md#the-fmaps-window-on-tsconf)).

## Watched ports

```{index} Watched Ports, port; watched
```

Right-click **PORTS**, or any port under it, and choose **Watched ports...** to change the
list.

![The Watched Ports window](images/dbg-watched-ports.png)

Each line is a port in hex. Four digits are a full address, matched as it is; two digits
are a byte port, matched on the low byte alone. Untick a port to stop showing it while
keeping it in the list. Of the buttons beside the list, {icon}`add` adds a port and
{icon}`cancel` removes the selected one. Double-click a port to change it.

The ports whose values the machine keeps in registers are added to the list automatically;
untick them if you do not need them. The list is kept for the machine that is running. The
**Ports** group of the **Debugger** page of **Options** is the same list.
