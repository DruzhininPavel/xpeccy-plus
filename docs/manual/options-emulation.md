- **Input lag** - **Low latency** and **Run ahead**. See [Input lag](#input-lag).
- **Speed and rewind** - how far back rewind goes, how the keys of Slow Motion, Fast
  Forward and Fast Mode work, and what Fast Mode shows. See [Speed and time](time.md).
- **Folder as a disk** - whether a folder used as a card or a disk takes what the machine
  writes, and where a file it deletes there goes. See
  [Writing to a folder](sd-hdd.md#writing-to-a-folder).

## Input lag

```{index} input lag, Low latency, Run ahead
```

The **Input lag** group on the **Emulation** page sets how soon a key press shows on the
screen.

**Low latency** shows each frame as soon as it is made. In a window the desktop still
holds each frame back by one more frame; in fullscreen that delay is skipped too, but menus
then flicker as they open. With **Low latency** off, frames are buffered, for smoother
motion. It is on by default.

**Run ahead** makes keys respond sooner by one or two frames. Each frame, the program
emulates that many frames further, shows the picture from there, and goes back. So you
see the result of a key press a frame or two earlier than the machine itself would show
it. The cost is CPU time - the frames are emulated more than once - and the sound stays
a frame behind the picture. **Off** is the default. Run ahead does nothing while an RZX
recording plays, in Fast Mode and Fast Forward, while the machine is paused, and while
you rewind.
