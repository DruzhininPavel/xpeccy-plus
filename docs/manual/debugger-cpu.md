# CPU panel

```{index} CPU panel, register, flag
```

![The CPU panel](images/dbg-cpu.png)

The **CPU** panel shows the Z80 registers: PC, AF, BC, DE, HL, SP, the alternate set AF',
BC', DE', HL', then IX, IY, IR, IM and the interrupt switches IFF1 and IFF2. Under them
are the flags S, Z, 5, H, 3, P, N and C.

A register that changed in the last step is marked in the **Changed** color of the
**Debugger** page of **Options**. With **Split pairs** on, only the byte that changed is
marked: after an instruction that changes only A, only the A half of AF lights up.

## Changing registers

```{index} register; changing
```

Click a value and type over it in hex. The change takes effect at once. In a value field:

- Up and Down, or the mouse wheel, add or subtract 1;
- PgUp and PgDn add or subtract 256;
- X switches the field between hex and decimal.

IFF1 and IFF2 are check boxes. Tick or untick a flag to change it in F.

Click the name of a register to see, in the listing, the code at the address the register
holds.
Right-click the name to see that address in the **DUMP** panel.

## Layouts

```{index} CPU panel; layout, Split pairs
```

Right-click the panel's title bar to choose how the registers are laid out. A small dot in
the corner of a title bar shows that the panel has such a menu.

- **Auto** (the default) - one column when the panel is narrow, two when it is wide enough.
  **Auto** also uses two columns when two panels stand side by side under the **CPU**
  panel.
- **1 column** - a register on each line.
- **2 columns** - two on a line, each beside its pair: AF beside AF', PC beside SP.
- **Wide** - a column for each kind: AF, BC, DE, HL; the alternate set; PC, SP, IX, IY; and
  IR, IM, IFF1, IFF2. The flags are one more column beside them, under the title **Flags**.
- **Split pairs** - mark only the byte that changed, as above. On by default.
