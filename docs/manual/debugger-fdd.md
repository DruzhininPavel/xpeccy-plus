# FDD panel

```{index} FDD panel, track; raw bytes
```

![The FDD panel](images/dbg-fdd.png)

The **FDD** panel shows a whole track of a floppy disk as it lies on the disk: the
gaps, the sector headers, the data and the checksums, byte by byte. It is on a tab beside
**DUMP**, and only on a machine with a disk interface.

- **Drive** - the drive, **A** to **D**.
- **Track** - the track to show, counted with both sides: 0 is the first track on side 0,
  1 the same track on side 1, 2 the next track on side 0, and so on. On a single-sided
  drive the number steps by 2.
- **Bytes per row** - **Auto**, **8/row**, **12/row** or **16/row**.
- {icon}`target` The target button - jumps to the drive, the track and the byte the head is
  at now.

Each row starts with the track and the place on the track, in hex: `02:0040`. The byte
under the head is in bold. Sector headers are in the **ID / Label** color of the
**Debugger** page of **Options**, sector data in the **Data** color and the checksums in
the **CRC** color. With no disk in the drive every byte reads `FF`. The panel cannot be
edited; to change a disk's files, use the **Disk Manager** (see
[Floppy disks](disks.md)).

Use it to see how a disk is laid out: how many sectors a track has, how long they are, and
whether a protected disk has a header or a checksum that is wrong on purpose.
