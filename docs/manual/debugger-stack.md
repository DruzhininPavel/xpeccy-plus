# STACK panel

```{index} STACK panel, Stack offset
```

![The STACK panel](images/dbg-stack.png)

Each line of the **STACK** panel is a word in memory, starting near the address SP holds.
The shaded line is the word at SP, named by its address. The lines above and below it are
named by their distance from SP: `-02:`, `+02:`, `+04:` and so on. The panel shows as
many lines as fit in its height.

The two arrows at the top move the lines by a word. The first line can be from 16 bytes
before SP to 16 bytes after it. Where the panel starts is the **Stack offset** on the **Debugger** page of **Options**:
`-2` by default, so the word just above SP is in view too.
